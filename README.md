## Getting started with writing your first plugin

This template includes 1 example plugin.

1. Open the root build.gradle.kts, read the comments and replace all the placeholders
2. Familiarize yourself with the project structure. Most files are commented
3. Build or deploy your first plugin using:
   - Windows: `.\gradlew.bat ExampleProvider:make` or `.\gradlew.bat ExampleProvider:deployWithAdb`
   - Linux & Mac: `./gradlew ExampleProvider:make` or `./gradlew ExampleProvider:deployWithAdb`

This template as well as the gradle plugin and the whole plugin system is **heavily** based on [Aliucord](https://github.com/Aliucord).
*Go use it, it's a great mobile discord client mod!*
